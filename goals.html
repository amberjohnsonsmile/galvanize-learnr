				<h2>Daily Goals</h2>
				<time datetime="2017-10-23">October 23, 2017</time>
				<h3>Goal 1: Continue to work on standards and drills</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>SPECIFIC - make progress on the goal-setting, meetup, and L2L standards.</li>
					<li>MEASUREABLE - spend an hour working on these.</li>
					<li>ACHIEVABLE - the L2L standard has significant work left to do. The goal-setting standard is almost finished. For the meetup standard, I mostly just need to choose a couple more meetups to go to.</li>
					<li>REALISTIC - an hour today should be very reasonable. Unless we do a lot of breakouts in class I should have a lot of time to do it.</li>
					<li>TIMELINE - I'll start work on this during my commute, and continue in class, planning to finish by the end of the day.</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>Goal 2: Create a Stack Overflow account.</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>SPECIFIC - make an account, explore features, and answer a question.</li>
					<li>MEASURABLE - explore Stack Overflow for twenty minutes.</li>
					<li>ACHIEVABLE - the only part I might not be able to do is answering a question. Hopefully someone will have a question I know the answer to!</li>
					<li>REALISTIC - twenty minutes will be easy to commit to.</li>
					<li>TIMELINE - I'll do this during my morning commute.</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>Goal 3: Learn more about Vim</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>SPECIFIC - find a quick tutorial of basic Vim commands.</li>
					<li>MEASURABLE - spend twenty minutes learning about and trying things in Vim.</li>
					<li>ACHIEVABLE - Vim is intimidating, which is why I want to start small and learn a little bit.</li>
					<li>REALISTIC - again, twenty minutes will be easy to fit in.</li>
					<li>TIMELINE - either morning or afternoon in class, done by end of day.</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>Reflection</h3>
				<p>My standards/drills goal and my Vim goal were met. Again, the standards and drills felt good because it was time-based rather than outcome-based. I did some research on what meetups to go to and finished two of the L2L drills. Learning about Vim was also a good experience. Twenty minutes was a nice amount of time to get an introduction. The most helpful thing that came out of it was a Vim cheat sheet that I downloaded. This will allow me to do things in Vim even though I don't have the commands memorized.</p>
				<p>The Stack Overflow goal was not met because I couldn't find a question I knew enough about to answer. I did create an account and explore the site, though, so that was good. And I'm sure as I learn more I'll be able to answer more questions. Honestly, if I were to do it over, I would still set the same goal. I didn't meet it, but it pushed me out of my comfort zone.</p>
				<p>Tomorrow I will keep setting goals that push me out of my comfort zone. If I set goals that are too easy to meet, I'm not learning as much as I could be.</p>

				<h2>Daily Goals</h2>
				<time datetime="2017-10-21">October 21, 2017</time>
				<h3>Goal 1: Make progress on standards and drills</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>SPECIFIC - work on the goal-setting, meetup, and learn-to-learn standards and drills.</li>
					<li>MEASUREABLE - spend an hour working on these.</li>
					<li>ACHIEVABLE - I've already started each of these, so it should be easy to pick up and continue them.</li>
					<li>REALISTIC - today's Saturday, plenty of time to fit in an hour!</li>
					<li>TIMELINE - finish by end of day.</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>Goal 2: Attend a meetup</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>SPECIFIC - for the EE-2 standard, go to the Coffee && Code meetup at Coffee Tree in Loveland.</li>
					<li>MEASUREABLE - stay for at least an hour, meet two new people.</li>
					<li>ACHIEVABLE - makes me nervous to think about meeting more experienced devs, but I'll need to get used to that so I'm going to push myself to go!</li>
					<li>REALISTIC - again, I have plenty of time to go. No school today!</li>
					<li>TIMELINE - 10:00 on Saturday.</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>Goal 3: Install new programs</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>SPECIFIC - we talked about a few programs in class that I want to install today - Flux, Zeplin, and the Adobe Capture app.</li>
					<li>MEASURABLE - install all three programs and make sure they work.</li>
					<li>ACHIEVABLE - I definitely know how to do this, just need to get it done!</li>
					<li>REALISTIC - I don't think this will take too long. Probably less than 20 minutes.</li>
					<li>TIMELINE - finish by end of day.</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>Reflection</h3>
				<p>My three goals were met today. The meetup went really well. The "measurable" part of that was to stay for an hour and meet two people, and I ended up staying almost two hours and meeting four people! It was also great that it was on the weekend, that makes it much easier for me to go to a meetup and not have to worry about the Fort Collins - Denver commute. Another thing that went well was progress on the standards and drills. I ended up getting a lot of goal setting done, plus I was able to write my meetup reflection. Having an hour rather than trying to accomplish a specific thing made me feel like there was less pressure. I will get everything done, and it will take however long it needs to take.</p>
				<p>The goal for installing programs was a little bit simple, so I think it could've been better. Next time I'd like to make a goal like that more specific. For instance, my goal could be to install Flux AND set up my preferences. Install Zeplin AND mess around with looking at the CSS on different pages.</p>
				<p>I'd like to use this line of thinking tomorrow to make sure all my goals are specific enough.</p>

				<h2>Daily Goals</h2>
				<time datetime="2017-10-20">October 20, 2017</time>
				<h3>Goal 1: Spend an hour researching an unfamiliar technology</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>SPECIFIC - use online searching to research. Take notes on what I learn.</li>
					<li>MEASUREABLE - one hour, take notes.</li>
					<li>ACHIEVABLE - I have the tools to do this research, and I'll try to make sure I'm pushing myself out of my comfort zone and learning new material.</li>
					<li>REALISTIC - can commit an hour of my workday to this.</li>
					<li>TIMELINE - finish by end of day.</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>Goal 2: Continue work on getting standards and drills completed</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>SPECIFIC - start work on the EE-2 (Attend Meetups) standard.</li>
					<li>MEASUREABLE - read all the informational materials and the drill instructions.</li>
					<li>ACHIEVABLE - shouldn't be a stretch to learn about meetups, since we've already talked about it a lot in class.</li>
					<li>REALISTIC - can commit time within my workday to do this - I don't think it'll take more than an hour.</li>
					<li>TIMELINE - finish by end of day.</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>Goal 3: Attend cohort mixer</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>SPECIFIC - go to the arcade night at Lucky Stripe organized by g64.</li>
					<li>MEASUREABLE - stay at least an hour, talk to two people from other cohorts that I haven't met before.</li>
					<li>ACHIEVABLE - I'm on the introverted side, so I'll have to push myself to talk to people, but two should be totally doable.</li>
					<li>REALISTIC - since I commute this will mean getting home pretty late, but I drove today so I won't have to worry about missing a bus.</li>
					<li>TIMELINE - event starts at 7, so I'll plan on going 7-8ish.</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>Reflection</h3>
				<p>Two goals were met and one wasn't. I met my goals for researching a technology and working on the meetups standard. I did not end up going to the cohort mixer.</p>
				<p>Setting aside a specific amount of time to research technology worked well. I didn't feel pressure to "finish" anything, I just took the time to explore and play and learn. Making progress on the meetup standard also panned out well because it was easily completed.</p>
				<p>I had planned on going to the cohort mixer, and I even drove to Denver (I commute from Fort Collins) instead of taking the bus so I could stay late enough. But by the time 7:00 came around, I felt really drained physically, mentally, emotionally, you name it. So I made the call that it would be best for me to head home and get some rest. The goal was a little bit unreasonable, but I think I needed to experience it to be able to see that. For one thing, driving rather than taking the bus made the day more stressful. For another, I just didn't realize how tired I would be after a week of school. Now that I know, I can make plans that are more realistic.</p>
				<p>Tomorrow I will try to keep all of my goals realistic. Also, I'd like to apply the success of setting "one hour" as a goal to my standards and drills. Rather than saying, "I'm going to complete standard X", I'll say "I'll spend an hour working on the standards."</p>
