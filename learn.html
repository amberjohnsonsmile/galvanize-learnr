				<h2>Semantic HTML</h2>
				<time datetime="2017-10-23">October 23, 2017</time>
				<h3>Set the Stage</h3>
				<p>For this learning session I'm working on the Semantic HTML excercise (https://github.com/gSchool/semantic-html-exercise). My goal is to spend an hour working on this today. It should be a good learning experience, because I understand semantic HTML as a concept but not so much how to actually use it. I should have plenty of time to fit this hour in, I'm blocking out some time in the morning.</p>
				<p>Semantic HTML is crucial to understand because it makes code easier to read, helps with accessibility, and influences search engine behavior. Basically it helps your code be more meaningful.</p>
				<p>To set the stage for this exercise, I started with my physical environment. I put away everything except my computer, a notebook and pen, and a water bottle. I also plugged the computer in so I wouldn't have to worry about running out of battery. I set a timer on my phone for two pomodoros of 25 minutes with a 5 minute break in the middle. In this <a href="https://youtu.be/gN3hGMMtVmk">video</a>, you can see how I set the stage on my computer. </p>
				<p>First I closed all the windows that weren't relevant to the Semantic HTML exercise. Then I opened iTunes to find some music to listen to on my headphones that wouldn't be too distracting. I muted my notifications. After navigating to the Semantic HTML exercise, I was ready to go!</p>
				<h3>Play</h3>
				<p>The exercise felt very straightforward. I compared my progress to the rubric to make sure I was changing all the div and span elements correctly. It took me a couple times looking over the HTML file to figure out where the head would be. Once I realized the nav tag was inside the head it made more sense.</p>
				<p>I ran into a couple of issues when I ran the document through the W3C validator. I hadn't realized that summary tags must be direct descendents of details tags. Also, the time tag was new to me. I hadn't added a datetime attribute, so the validator flagged it as an error. Once I fixed those two things the file passed inspection.</p>
				<p>I tried to be pretty free during the exercise. I messed around with different ways of structuring the tags in the file. I googled things I was curious about. That's how I got more information about the time tag and the details and summary tags. It helped that I gave myself an hour to work on the exercise rather than having a goal just to finish the exercise.</p>
				<h3>Reflection</h3>
				<p>Setting the stage helped a lot. With fewer windows open and no notifications, there was less distraction from the computer. The music helped me focus because there were other people around, and it allowed me to ignore them and zone in on what I was doing. The exercise ended up taking less than an hour, but it was nice that I blocked out that amount of time because I felt free to explore the concept a little more on my own.</p>
				<p>One thing I wish I'd done differently is using the pomodoro timer on my computer instead of on my phone. There's just no reason to get the phone involved if I don't have to.</p>
				<p>I'm excited to use semantic HTML - I've been curious about it since doing the personal site project. I'm not sure I fully grasp the variety of tags and which is best for what, but I'll keep learning as I go. Another semantic HTML issue I'm curious about has to do with CSS, and when to use classes vs. IDs vs. type selectors.</p>

				<h2>Vim</h2>
				<time datetime="2017-10-23">October 23, 2017</time>
				<h3>Set the Stage</h3>
				<p>Kyle has used the Vim text editor a few times to show us things in class and it seems like a really powerful tool. I'm interested in learning more about it and trying some simple edits. I'll be following along with a "Vim Basics" video on YouTube. I've committed to spending twenty minutes learning about Vim right after lunch.</p>
				<p>Again, I started my stage-clearing with my physical space. I put away everything but my plugged-in computer, a notebook/pen, and some coffee. <a href="https://youtu.be/689awTcwamk">Here</a> is another video of my computer stage-setting.</p>
				<p>I closed all unnecessary applications and opened the Vim video and the Terminal. After making sure my notifications were muted, I started the pomodoro timer (on my computer this time!). I didn't set up any music to play, because I'll be listening to the video through my headphones.</p>
				<h3>Play</h3>
				<p>I got the very basics of opening, editing, and saving files on Vim. At least now if I open a file in Vim I'll know what to do! The video I watched was helpful, and suggested finding a cheat sheet for Vim commands. I googled "Vim cheat sheet" and downloaded one that I liked. The cheat sheet helped me just go into Vim and try some things, and see what happened. After that I still had a few minutes to explore so I found a Vim practice tutorial at openvim.com. That was pretty fun, I liked how interactive it was. And it made me laugh because at one point the tutorial says "iAll work is only playEsc". Very appropriate for the "play" stage of learning!</p>
				<h3>Reflection</h3>
				<p>The stage setting helped me focus on just Vim. I ended up listening to music, too, after I had watched the video, which helped me stay focused. It was fun just messing around in Vim with the cheat sheet. No pressure.</p>
				<p>I plan to use Vim to make quick edits instead of going to the trouble of opening Atom. It would be a lot faster. Getting good at Vim will help me navigate around and make changes quickly without having to leave the command line. Plus once I get more advanced I know there's some pretty cool multi-selection stuff that saves even more time.</p>

				<h2>Building Websites</h2>
				<time datetime="2017-10-23">October 23, 2017</time>
				<h3>Set the Stage</h3>
				<p>I'm starting the TS-1 standard on building websites. I haven't read any of the informational materials yet so I'll begin with those. My goal is to do two 25-minute pomodoros working on TS-1. If all I do is read the info, that's great. If I get through that I'll start the drills. I've got an hour blocked out in the afternoon to work on this.</p>
				<p>Learning about HTML and building websites is going to be super important for us. This knowledge will form the foundation of our front-end web development skills.</p>
				<p>Clear the stage! Starting with my physical space, I cleared away everything except my computer (plugged in), my notebook/pen, and some water and tea. <a href="https://youtu.be/HD6aY17_jmo">Here</a> is a video of me clearing my digital space.</p>
				<p>I closed all the windows I didn't need, muted my notifications, and turned on some calming music. After navigating to the first article in the TS-1 section, I started my pomodoro for 25 minutes.</p>
				<h3>Play</h3>
				<p>During my two pomodoros, I made progress on the first informational article, "Intro to HTML." I played around with the different elements to see what they looked like on the index.html page. It was fun to see the different text styles just based on tags. Trying different character entities was neat. I had encountered these before but didn't even know what they were called. None of the info so far was super new, but it was good review.</p>
				<h3>Reflection</h3>
				<p>My stage setting went fine, but I still had trouble concentrating during the times that I was reading. I think a more isolated environment may have helped in this case. Part of it's just that time of day, in the afternoon I tend to be a bit sleepy. Maybe I can schedule more busy-work type tasks in the afternoon, and do reading in the morning when my mind feels more awake.</p>
				<p>Knowing HTML well is going to enable me to perform well on projects, and more importantly to be good at my future job! When we start making more complicated web apps, having HTML down will mean one less thing to worry about. The whole process will be more efficient.</p>
