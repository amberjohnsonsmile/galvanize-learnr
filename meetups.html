				<h2>Pybeer</h2>

				<h3>People</h3>
				<p>Bill runs the meetup. He's actually a web developer who happens to love python! He works at Ires, which develops a "multiple listing service" web app for real estate companies. He's also a Vim user, so he suggested some good resources to help me learn Vim.</p>
				<p>Annie introduced herself as "trying to be a data scientist." When I asked about her experience, she told me she's currently working on a project that mines data sets to correlate political tweets with bills passed in the last year. At that point I told her that she IS a data scientist. Annie is currently looking for work, and in her spare time she volunteers with First Lego and the local Science O team.</p>
				<h3>Learning</h3>
				<p>One python-enthusiast brought in an "All Programmable System on Chips," which I had never seen before. It looked like a hard drive without the casing. It was a Xilinx PYNQ, which allows you to control the system directly with Python. From what the guy said it can do some pretty powerful processing stuff.</p>
				<p>I also learned that the government shares all of their bills in searchable form. Twitter, however, will only share the last six days of tweets unless you pay for more. Annie was using a set of political tweets collected over time by an independant source.</p>
				<h3>Questions</h3>
				<p>Is python often used outside the context of data science?</p>
				<p>Are there any other program-specific meetups in Fort Collins?</p>

				<h3>People</h3>
				<p>Abel is an accountant at Ernst and Young, but hates it. He's got a data science background and is really interested in coding. It sounds like he's looking to make a career transition.</p>
				<p>Ben and Devin work at a place called Digabit that sells mechanical parts to companies. They recently switched from Ember to Vue, so they know a lot about it.</p>
				<h3>Learning</h3>
				<p>I had never heard of Vue, so I got a nice overview! Vue is a JavaScript framework that makes coding faster and easier. It doesn't seem crazy complicated, and according to the people at the meetup the documentation is pretty good. Sounds like a new version just came out, Vue 2.0.</p>
				<p>I had to leave the meetup early to catch a bus, and I didn't like that. For one it just felt rude. Plus I didn't really get into the project to see what using Vue was like. It's been hard for me to figure out how to fit meetups in because of my commute - the latest bus leaves at 7, and it seems like most Denver meetups start at 6 or later. I may be able to find meetups in Fort Collins after I get home, but I'm not sure they happen that late. Weekends could be an option. Anyway, in future I'm only going to go to a meetup if I can go to the whole thing, unless it's purely social.</p>
				<h3>Questions</h3>
				<p>What would be the advantage of Vue over Ember? Why would a company use one rather than the other?</p>
				<p>Are there any Vue meetups in Fort Collins? (Or any other framework-type meetups?)</p>

				<h2>Code && Coffee</h2>
				<time datetime="2017-10-21">October 21, 2017</time>
				<h3>People</h3>
				<p>Brian works remotely for a startup called Fancy Hands, which connects users with assistants who perform simple to-do list tasks such as phone calls. He works mostly in Ruby.</p>
				<p>Chad runs the meetup, and works for a company called Tummy (I almost didn't believe either of them about their company names). He also works in Ruby - sounds like the meetup was initially started by a group of Ruby developers, but they welcome everyone.</p>
				<h3>Learning</h3>
				<p>I was expecting the meetup to be much quieter - a group of developers working at a table, asking a question or making a comment every once in a while. It wasn't like that at all! The meetup was focused on socializing. Yes, everyone had their computers out and was messing around with code, but mostly people were there to make new friends who share common interests. Thinking of it that way made the whole process a lot less intimidating. Plus everyone was super welcoming.</p>
				<p>I also learned that Sandi Metz gives great talks about Ruby. Sounds like I'm not at a point yet where I'd be able to understand the info she covers, but it'll be good to keep in mind. Especially if I go in a Ruby direction. The developers at the meetup said she's their hero!</p>
				<h3>Questions</h3>
				<p>Why are there not more code/coffee meetups in Fort Collins? I didn't really find any when searching, but maybe there just weren't any this week. If there aren't, maybe it would be feasible to start one. I don't need to be an expert coder to start a meetup group. Plus if it was twice a month on the weekend that wouldn't be too much of a time commitment. Hmm....</p>
				<p>The devs at the meetup talked mostly about Ruby. What kind of jobs would Ruby be well suited for?</p>
